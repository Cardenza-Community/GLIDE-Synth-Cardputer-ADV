This file lists the software inside GLIDE.bin that was written by other people,
and reproduces the licences that require it. Keep it with the firmware: if you
pass the binary on — a download, a copy on an SD card, or a device with GLIDE
flashed on it — this file goes with it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your rights in this component, and how to exercise them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Arduino core for ESP32 is LGPL-2.1-or-later and is statically linked into
GLIDE.bin. Section 6 of that licence gives you the right to modify the core and
relink it into a working GLIDE binary. To make that real:

  * The Cardenza port's complete buildable source is at
    https://github.com/Cardenza-Community/GLIDE-Synth-Cardputer-ADV
    Build with `pio run -e cardenza` against the exact versions pinned in
    platformio.ini. See CARDENZA.md for the historical upstream source commit.

  * The core's own source is at https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32
    at the version named above.

  * If you would rather have the linkable object files than rebuild from
    source, ask and you will get them, for any binary released in the past
    three years: morphstudioshd@gmail.com, subject "GLIDE LGPL relink".
    That offer is open to anyone who holds a copy of the binary, at no charge
    beyond the cost of delivery.

  * You may reverse-engineer and debug your own modifications to this
    component. Nothing in GLIDE's licence forbids it, and no term of sale for
    a device carrying GLIDE will be read to forbid it.

This applies to the LGPL component. GLIDE's own code stays under the terms at
the top of this file.
