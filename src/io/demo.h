// Demo mode: the instrument plays itself. Spells a chord progression on the
// REAL backing engine, improvises over it with the seeded dsp phrase
// generator (slides on display), and wanders the curated bank — identity card
// and synth morph included. The exit is the feature: any grid key stops the
// melody but leaves the bed looping, and you're just... playing over it.
