// GLIDE patch serialization — a forward/backward-compatible TAGGED format.
//
// The whole point: adding new sound parameters must NEVER again invalidate a
// user's saved patches. The old fixed-struct blob discarded every save whenever
// dsp::SynthParams grew (the documented v3/v4 "revert to factory" behaviour).
// Here each field is a numbered record; the decoder overwrites only the tags it
// finds and leaves everything else at the caller-seeded default. A save that
// predates a field simply lacks that tag -> the field keeps its default. New
// firmware reading an old save, or old firmware reading a new save, both work.
//
// Lives in storage/ (may use Arduino), NOT in dsp/ (the pure-C++ porting
// boundary). The native test build does not compile storage/, so this is
// invisible to env:native / test_dsp.cpp.
