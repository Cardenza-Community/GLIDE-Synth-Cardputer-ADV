// The coach — everything that teaches the fn layer with the player's own hands.
//
// Why it exists: ten out of ten real players never found fn+k / fn+s /
// hold-fn+k / fn+q..p — the most-used gestures on the instrument — after days
// to weeks. The intro card proved WHY: read-and-dismiss teaching at minute
// zero has no retention (any key dismisses it, and pressing keys is the first
// thing every player does). So the coach never teaches by prose alone:
//
// - The TUTORIAL is a playable ritual: a bottom banner asks for one gesture
//   and advances only when the player's fingers actually perform it. The
//   instrument keeps playing the whole time — the banner watches the key
//   event stream, it never takes the keyboard away. ` skips; a settings row
//   replays. Auto-runs on a fresh unit (replacing the intro card); existing
//   units get a one-time offer card instead.
// - The TIPS are one-shot contextual toasts, fired at the moment a player
//   demonstrably has the problem the gesture solves (lots of off-scale shift
//   notes -> fn+k/fn+s exists), and permanently suppressed the moment they
//   use the gesture themselves. At most one per session, at most once ever.
