// ---- the LISTEN verdict: the song is the czar ------------------------------
// The Krumhansl profiles answer major-or-minor at some root; real rooms are
// full of modal music where that's the wrong question — an Am7-D9 Dorian vamp
// reads "D major" as honestly as "A minor". landListen turns the raw guess
// into a refined (tonic, mode) and lands the song's OWN scale at its tonic.
// It takes no player scale: what the instrument was in before the hold is
// not evidence about the song (field verdict, 2026-09-22 — "do not use the
// scale you're previously in to decide what the next one should be"; the old
// family mapping kept a Blues player in Blues for every song, and its
// relative-root rule put an exotic-scale player a third off the tonic).
//
//   1. Degree evidence upgrades the mode: strong b7 over the major 7 makes a
//      major verdict Mixolydian; a natural 6 over the b6 makes a minor one
//      Dorian. Weak evidence keeps the plain side (Ionian / Aeolian).
//   2. The tonic tiebreak: a Mixolydian-flavoured major verdict at X shares
//      its pitch set with Dorian at X+7 and plain Ionian at X+5. If either
//      rival's profile score sits within kTiebreakEps of the winner, the
//      tonic moves there — the Oye Como Va fix, and the G-major-heard-D-first
//      fix.
//   3. The landing is the mode's seven-note canvas at the tonic (Major,
//      Natural minor, Dorian, Mixolydian), rootPc == tonicPc always.
//
// Two safety layers guard that canvas, because a wrong seven-note landing
// plays a sour note where the pentatonic would simply omit it (measured on
// 47 field listens: the canvas soured 18, the pentatonic 9):
//   - CONFLICTED DEGREE: the song audibly plays BOTH versions of the deciding
//     degree (borrowed chords, melodic-minor lines) — any canvas has a
//     coin-flip sour note baked in, so it lands the side's pentatonic at the
//     tonic instead.
//   - SOURNESS: the canvas is scored by the energy heard at the out-of-set
//     semitone neighbours of the degrees it ASSERTS; if it is clearly sourer
//     than the side's pentatonic it retreats to that pentatonic. This is
//     what catches the modes the four-mode vocabulary can't name (a Lydian
//     #4 against the canvas P4, a Phrygian b2 against the canvas 2).
//   - UNSURE: a verdict whose song-aware confidence never reached 0.4 (only
//     possible for a listen that ran its whole budget — the stop rule needs
//     0.5) lands the pentatonic too. Measured: nothing-sour 29 -> 32 of 47.
// chroma is KeyGuess::chroma (peak-normalized; correlation is scale-invariant);
// confidence is classifyChromaSong's.
