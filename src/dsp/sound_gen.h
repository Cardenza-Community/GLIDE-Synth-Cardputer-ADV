// Rolls a complete, musically-bounded patch from a seed, or mutates an existing
// one to explore its neighbourhood. Seeded and DETERMINISTIC: the same seed
// always yields the same patch. Two payoffs fall out of that:
//   - a per-device seed gives every unit a unique-but-reproducible starting
//     bank (no two players' instruments sound alike out of the box), and
//   - the host tests can pin the behaviour exactly (env:native).
//
// PURE C++: no Arduino, no M5, no millis(), no global RNG state. All randomness
// flows from the `seed` argument through a local LCG. This lives under the
// dsp/ porting boundary and must keep compiling in env:native — so the soul of
// the instrument (its sound *generator*) ports to future hardware unchanged,
// exactly like the synth voice does.

// The character a roll commits to BEFORE painting parameters. This is what
// makes two rolls sound like two different instruments instead of two shades
// of the same one: independent uniform draws regress every patch to the
// statistical middle ("a buzzy wave with some reverb"), so the generator first
// picks a personality, then paints correlated values inside that personality's
// window — plucks that actually stop, pads that actually swell, acid that
// actually squelches. Wild keeps the old anything-goes chaos in the pool.
// Append-only (a future "roll style" picker may persist it): add before Count.
//
// The second wave (genver 3) fills the holes the first nine couldn't reach:
//   Whistle — the slide-whistle / theremin lineage voice: a SUSTAINED pure
//             wave (Lead never rolls sine/tri; Bell is percussive), breath
//             noise, singing vibrato, glide-forward. The original instrument.
//   Organ   — instant-on held drawbar stack (square/sine + sub) under a
//             rotary tremolo, and NO filter envelope — no other archetype
//             can roll a full-sustain tone with zero per-note bloom.
//   Keys    — the tine piano: soft filter ping, a held middle sustain no
//             pluck reaches, tremolo. The comping voice.
//   Wobble  — sub bass whose filter breathes on a TEMPO-SYNCED LFO, locked
//             to the jam clock like the delay is. Nothing else rolls deep
//             synced cutoff movement.
//   Strings — the bowed ensemble: fat-saw + heavy chorus + section vibrato,
//             attack between pluck and pad. Brighter and quicker than a pad.
// The third wave (genver 5) fills the two GESTURE holes left after the first
// fourteen — not new timbres so much as new ways a note behaves in time:
//   Drone   — the meditative held-forever voice: slow bloom, sustain pinned
//             high, long release, sub weight, a big room, glacial motion.
//             Nothing else rolls "holds indefinitely and barely moves."
//   Gate    — the trance gate: a held tone whose VOLUME chops on a
//             tempo-synced square LFO. Wobble moves the filter in time;
//             nothing before this moved the amp in time.

uint32_t patchHash(const GenPatch& g);

// The COMPREHENSIVE hash: every field a patch persists (the codec table),
// except the player's master volume and the live-mod fields. This is the hash

// missed field silently loses a player's work — patchHash() deliberately skips
// some fields for name stability, so it must never be used for those jobs.

// and the library browser, where there's room for the full name.
void nameForSeed(uint32_t seed, char* out, int cap);

// A COMPACT label from the same seed — one word (the noun, e.g. "haze"), ≤6

// beside the scale/octave readouts. Shares the noun with nameForSeed(), so a
// slot labelled "haze" and its SD file "warm-haze-3f2a" read as the same sound.
void shortNameForSeed(uint32_t seed, char* out, int cap);

// THE canonical auto-name: adjective-noun, e.g. "warm-haze" — no hex tag. This
// is the ONE name a sound shows everywhere (slot, status bar, SD library, the
// Save default), so what you see is always what you save. Uniqueness across the
// library is handled by rename + a save-time collision suffix, not a hex tag.
// Same words as nameForSeed()/shortNameForSeed(); deterministic from the seed.
// LEGACY vocabulary: kept (frozen) because genver-1 devices derive their o/p
// slot labels through it — new names come from soundNameForPatch() below.
void soundName(uint32_t seed, char* out, int cap);

// Classify an arbitrary patch into the archetype FAMILY it most SOUNDS like —
// pure parameter heuristics (percussive first, then squelch, swell, weight…),
// so it works on hand-built, mutated, and legacy sounds too, not just fresh
// archetype rolls. Drives the character-aware namer; free for future UI use
// (e.g. a family badge on the sound card).
Archetype classifySound(const SynthParams& s);

// The VERSIONED classifier (v2): recognises the second- and third-wave
// families the frozen classifySound deliberately cannot return (whistle,
// organ, keys, wobble, strings, drone, gate), falling back to the frozen
// heuristics for everything else. Used ONLY where a name is minted fresh
// (rolls, mutates, genver>=5 slot regen) — the frozen classifier keeps naming
// everything that re-derives on older devices, so nobody is ever relabelled.
Archetype classifySoundV2(const SynthParams& s);

// The character-aware namer: the adjective follows the patch's timbre (texture,
// then brightness), the noun its classified family — a bell gets bell words, a
// bass gets weight words — with the word choice inside each bank drawn from
// patchHash bits. Deterministic, filename-safe, same adjective-noun shape as
// soundName(). This is the namer for all NEWLY-minted names (rolls, mutates,
// genver>=2 slot regen, nameless-save fallbacks); genver-1 devices keep
// deriving their o/p labels with soundName() so an update never relabels them.
void soundNameForPatch(const GenPatch& g, char* out, int cap);

// The v2 namer: identical word logic to soundNameForPatch, but the noun bank
// follows classifySoundV2 — so a drone finally names like a drone ("dusky om")
// and a gate like a gate, and the second wave's reserved noun rows become
// reachable. Same freshly-minted-only rule as the classifier above.
